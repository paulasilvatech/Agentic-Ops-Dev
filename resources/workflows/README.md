### 3. Observability Health Check (`observability-monitoring.yml`)
**Purpose**: Scheduled monitoring to ensure all observability components are functioning correctly.

**Triggers**:
- Hourly schedule (cron)
- Manual dispatch with environment selection
- Optional deep analysis mode

**Key Features**:
- Prometheus health and target validation
- Log ingestion rate monitoring
- Distributed tracing validation
- Alert routing verification
- Dashboard performance checks

- SLO/SLI calculations
- AI agent health

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Set up required GitHub secrets in your repository settings
3. Ensure Azure subscription is properly configured
4. Have the workshop infrastructure deployed

### Setting Up Secrets

Navigate to your repository's Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions, then add:

```yaml
# Azure Authentication
AZURE_CREDENTIALS: |
  {
    "clientId": "your-client-id",
    "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
    "subscriptionId": "your-subscription-id",
    "tenantId": "your-tenant-id"
  }

# Application Insights
APP_INSIGHTS_KEY: "your-instrumentation-key"
APP_INSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING: "InstrumentationKey=...;IngestionEndpoint=..."

# Third-party Services
SONAR_TOKEN: "your-sonarcloud-token"
SNYK_TOKEN: "your-snyk-token"
GRAFANA_API_KEY: "your-grafana-api-key"

# Notifications (Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
```

### Running Workflows

1. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run deploy-observability.yml \
     -f environment=development \
     -f azure_subscription_id=your-sub-id \
     -f deploy_ai_monitoring=true
   ```

2. **Trigger CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Simply push code changes to trigger automatic builds
   - Create pull requests for code review with automated testing

3. **Manual Health Check**:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run observability-monitoring.yml \
     -f environment=production \
     -f deep_analysis=true
   ```

## üìä Workflow Integration Points

### Metrics Collection
All workflows send custom metrics to Application Insights:
- Build duration and success rates
- Deployment frequency and lead time
- Test execution results
- Performance benchmarks

### Distributed Tracing
Workflows demonstrate trace context propagation:
- Build-to-deployment correlation
- Cross-service transaction tracking
- Performance bottleneck identification

### Logging
Structured logging throughout workflows:
- Consistent log formatting
- Correlation IDs for tracking
- Error aggregation and analysis

### Alerting
Automated alerts for:
- Build failures
- Deployment issues
- Performance degradation
- SLO violations

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Applications
1. Add application to the build matrix in `application-cicd.yml`
2. Ensure Dockerfile includes telemetry configuration
3. Add corresponding Kubernetes manifests

### Modifying Deployment Strategies
The workflows support multiple deployment patterns:
- **Blue-Green**: Modify `blue-green-deploy.sh` script
- **Canary**: Adjust `progressive-rollout.sh` parameters
- **Rolling**: Configure in Kubernetes deployment specs

### Extending Health Checks
Add new validation steps to `observability-monitoring.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Custom Validation
  run: |
    ./resources/scripts/your-custom-check.sh \
      --environment ${{ inputs.environment }}
```

## üìà Monitoring Workflow Performance

### Workflow Metrics Dashboard
Import the included Grafana dashboard to monitor:
- Workflow execution times
- Success/failure rates
- Resource utilization
- Cost analysis

### Workflow Observability
Each workflow includes:
- Detailed logging at each step
- Performance timing annotations
- Error tracking and reporting
- Resource usage monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify Azure credentials are correctly formatted JSON
   - Check service principal permissions
   - Ensure subscription ID matches

2. **Container Registry Access**
   - Verify ACR authentication in workflows
   - Check repository permissions
   - Ensure image tags are correct

3. **Monitoring Stack Errors**
   - Check Kubernetes cluster connectivity
   - Verify namespace creation
   - Review resource quotas

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in workflows:
```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new workflows:
1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Add error handling and retries
4. Include observability integration
5. Test in a development environment first
