##  Beginner Workshop (2 hours)

###  Introduction: Modern Cloud Observability and Agentic DevOps (15 minutes)

####  The Evolution of Monitoring

| **🕰️ Era** | ** Monitoring Approach** | ** Detection Time** | ** Characteristics** |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **📟 Traditional IT (1990s-2000s)** | Server room with blinking lights, manual log checking | Hours to days | Reactive alerts: "Server is down!" |
| **☁️ Cloud Monitoring (2010s)** | Dashboard-driven monitoring, automated metrics | Minutes to hours | Proactive alerts: "CPU usage high" |
| ** Modern Observability (2020s)** | Three pillars: Metrics, Logs, Traces | Seconds to minutes | Context-aware: "Customer checkout failing" |
| **🤖 AI-Enhanced (2024+)** | Intelligent agents, predictive detection | Predictive | Self-healing before issues occur |

#### 🤖 What is Agentic DevOps?

** Traditional DevOps**:
> "Union of people, process, and technology to enable continuous delivery"

** Agentic DevOps**:
> "AI-powered agents operating as members of your dev and ops teams, automating, optimizing, and accelerating every stage of the software lifecycle"

#### 🏛️ The Three Pillars of Observability

##### 1.  Metrics (What happened?)
```yaml
Characteristics:
  - Numerical measurements over time
  - Examples: CPU usage, response times, error rates  
  - Use cases: Alerts, trending, capacity planning
  - Storage: Efficient time-series databases
```

##### 2.  Logs (What happened in detail?)
```yaml
Characteristics:
  - Text records of discrete events
  - Examples: Error messages, user actions, system events
  - Use cases: Debugging, investigation, audit trails
  - Storage: Full-text searchable systems
```

##### 3. 🔗 Traces (How did it happen?)
```yaml
Characteristics:
  - Request flow through distributed systems
  - Examples: User request journey across services
  - Use cases: Performance optimization, dependency mapping
  - Storage: Distributed tracing systems
```

** Checkpoint**: 
-  Your application should be running locally
-  Telemetry should appear in Application Insights Live Metrics
-  Health checks should return successful responses
-  API endpoints should respond correctly
-  Swagger documentation should be accessible

###  Workshop Progress Check
At this point, you have accomplished:

| ** Achievement** | ** Status** | ** Verification** |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **🏗️ Azure Infrastructure** | Complete | Resource group with Log Analytics and Application Insights |
| **📱 Sample Application** | Complete | .NET web API with comprehensive telemetry |
| ** Telemetry Flow** | Complete | Live Metrics showing real-time data |
| **🏥 Health Monitoring** | Complete | Multiple health check endpoints |
| ** API Testing** | Complete | All endpoints responding correctly |

** Continue to Part 2** for:
-  Creating custom dashboards and intelligent alerts
- 🤖 AI-assisted troubleshooting with GitHub Copilot  
-  Proactive monitoring implementation
- 🤖 Introduction to Azure SRE Agent

---

## ➡️ Next Steps

** Part 2 - Beginner Workshop Modules 2-5** will cover:
- ** Module 2**: Creating Your First Dashboard and Alerts (25 minutes)
- **🤖 Module 3**: AI-Assisted Troubleshooting with GitHub Copilot (30 minutes)
- ** Module 4**: Implementing Proactive Monitoring (35 minutes)
- **🤖 Module 5**: Introduction to Azure SRE Agent (15 minutes)

###  Ready for Part 2? Ensure you have:
-  **Application running** and sending telemetry to Azure Monitor
-  **Azure resources** created successfully and accessible
-  **GitHub Copilot** active and working in VS Code
-  **Basic understanding** of observability concepts and workshop goals

###  Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. ** Check configuration**: Review values in your `workshop-config.txt` file
2. **🔗 Verify connection**: Ensure `CONNECTION_STRING` is properly set
3. ** Check Azure Portal**: Confirm resources are created and accessible
4. ** Review logs**: Check application output for any error messages
5. ** Consult documentation**: Reference troubleshooting section in Part 5

** Congratulations!** You've successfully completed Part 1 of the Azure Observability Workshop. Your foundation is now ready for advanced monitoring scenarios.

###  Quick Reference: Automation Resources

Remember, all the manual steps you've learned are automated in the `resources/` directory:

```bash
# Complete workshop setup
./resources/quick-start.sh deploy YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
./resources/quick-start.sh start

# Individual components
./resources/scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
./resources/scripts/deploy-monitoring.sh
./resources/scripts/deploy-applications.sh

# Helper utilities
./resources/scripts/helpers/port-forward-grafana.sh
./resources/scripts/helpers/generate-load.sh
./resources/scripts/helpers/start-workshop-env.sh
```

###  Automation Resources Reference

| ** Script** | ** Purpose** | **⏱️ Time Saved** |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| `quick-start.sh` | Complete workshop deployment and management | 45+ minutes |
| `deploy-infrastructure.sh` | Azure resources (AKS, monitoring, storage) | 20 minutes |
| `deploy-monitoring.sh` | Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger setup | 15 minutes |
| `deploy-applications.sh` | Sample apps with full telemetry | 10 minutes |
| Helper scripts | Port forwarding, load generation, utilities | 5+ minutes |

** Pro Tip**: Use the automation for quick setup, then customize the generated configurations to match your specific requirements!
