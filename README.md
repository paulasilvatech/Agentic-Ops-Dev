## üìñ The Journey to AI-Enhanced Observability

Welcome to the Azure AI Ops Observability Workshop! This repository takes you on a transformative journey from traditional monitoring to the world of AI-assisted observability and agentic DevOps.

As a cloud engineer in today's distributed systems environment, you face a critical challenge: **traditional monitoring only shows you what's wrong, not why or how to fix it**. According to the observability introduction:

* Traditional monitoring approaches only catch problems you anticipated
* High alert fatigue leads to missed critical issues (false positives)
* Difficult to correlate issues across distributed microservices
* Reactive troubleshooting instead of proactive optimization

This workshop provides hands-on guidance to implement modern observability using the three pillars approach - metrics, logs, and traces - enhanced with AI capabilities. We'll demonstrate how Azure SRE Agent and other advanced tools can transform your monitoring strategy.

> "Observability is not about the data you collect, but about the questions you can answer with that data."
