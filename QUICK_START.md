## üìö Key Concepts to Understand

### The Three Pillars of Observability

**üèõÔ∏è Foundation Concepts:**
- ** Metrics**: Numerical measurements over time (CPU, memory, request rates)
- ** Logs**: Discrete events with detailed context (errors, transactions, user actions)
- **üîó Traces**: Request flows across distributed services (latency, dependencies)

### Modern Observability vs Traditional Monitoring

| Aspect | Traditional Monitoring | Modern Observability |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Approach** | Known unknowns | Unknown unknowns |
| **Data Types** | Simple metrics | Metrics + Logs + Traces |
| **Analysis** | Reactive alerts | Proactive insights |
| **Intelligence** | Rule-based | AI-enhanced |

### Azure Observability Stack

```yaml
Azure Observability Architecture:
  Data Collection:
    - Application Insights  # Application telemetry
    - Azure Monitor         # Infrastructure metrics
    - Log Analytics        # Centralized logging
  
  Data Processing:
    - KQL Queries          # Advanced analytics
    - Smart Detection      # AI-powered anomalies
    - Custom Metrics       # Business KPIs
  
  Visualization:
    - Azure Dashboards     # Native visualization
    - Grafana             # Advanced dashboards
    - Power BI            # Business intelligence
  
  Actions:
    - Smart Alerts        # Intelligent notifications
    - Auto-scaling        # Dynamic resource adjustment
    - Automated Remediation # Self-healing systems
```
