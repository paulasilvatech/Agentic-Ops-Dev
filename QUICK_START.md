## 📚 Key Concepts to Understand

### The Three Pillars of Observability

**🏛️ Foundation Concepts:**
- **📊 Metrics**: Numerical measurements over time (CPU, memory, request rates)
- **📝 Logs**: Discrete events with detailed context (errors, transactions, user actions)
- **🔗 Traces**: Request flows across distributed services (latency, dependencies)

### Modern Observability vs Traditional Monitoring

| Aspect | Traditional Monitoring | Modern Observability |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Approach** | Known unknowns | Unknown unknowns |
| **Data Types** | Simple metrics | Metrics + Logs + Traces |
| **Analysis** | Reactive alerts | Proactive insights |
| **Intelligence** | Rule-based | AI-enhanced |

### Azure Observability Stack

```yaml
Azure Observability Architecture:
  Data Collection:
    - Application Insights  # Application telemetry
